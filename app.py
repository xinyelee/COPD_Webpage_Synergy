This dataset includes key features impacting COPD exacerbation risk, along with engineered features aimed at enhancing prediction accuracy:

- **Age**: Older age often correlates with higher exacerbation risk.
- **Smoking History**: Duration and status of smoking, critical in respiratory conditions.
- **Spirometry Values (FEV1, FVC)**: Measures of lung function, where lower values indicate airflow limitation.
- **Engineered Features**: Includes rolling averages, lagged values, and interaction terms for temporal patterns.
- **Comorbidities**: Presence of conditions like cardiovascular disease may influence exacerbation risk.
""")

st.markdown("## Key Insights")
st.write("""
Insights derived from the models and SHAP analysis include:

- **Age** and **Smoking History** are consistent predictors of exacerbation risk.
- **Spirometry Values** (FEV1, FVC) are strong indicators, with lower values linked to higher risk.
- **Comorbidities** add context for assessing risk in patients with complex health profiles.
