This dataset includes key features that impact COPD exacerbation risk, along with engineered features aimed at enhancing prediction accuracy and model insights:

- **Age**: Older age is often associated with higher exacerbation risk.
- **Smoking History**: Duration of smoking, critical in assessing respiratory conditions.
- **Spirometry Values (FEV1, FVC)**: Measures of lung function; lower values indicate severe airflow limitation.
- **Engineered Features**: Includes rolling averages and lagged spirometry values to capture temporal trends.
- **Comorbidities**: Presence of other conditions, such as cardiovascular issues, may influence exacerbation risk.

# Key Insights Section
st.markdown("## Key Insights")
st.write("""
Here are some primary insights derived from the models and SHAP analysis:

- **Age** and **Smoking History** are significant predictors of exacerbation risk.
- **Spirometry Values** (FEV1, FVC) are crucial indicators, with lower values linked to higher risk.
- **Comorbidities** add valuable context for assessing risk among patients with complex health profiles.
